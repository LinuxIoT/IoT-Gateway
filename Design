1. We need to print the headers. Hence , we need a class that can print it for us. 
	* print_headers.py

2. We need to initiallize the system. Has it the desired configuartion.
	* init.py
   As we need to read some of settings from .conf file. Hence, we need a conf_parser module.
	* sysconfigx.py

3. Serial Initialization based on the parameters defined in .conf file.
	* serial_config.py

4. Now its time to get the frame from serial port.
	* serial_frame.py 	--> 	To initiallize the each field size, and methods for serial read-line and write.
	* serial_raw_queue.py 	--> 	Define a queue to store the raw data read from serial port
	* serial_IO		-->	A thread that continuously read data from serail port and put it into raw data queue

5. Now, a thread will filter the raw data stored in a serial_queue. And put it into another filtered queue named as CFAR_queue
	* frame_FILTER.py	-->	It filters the frame
	* CFAR_queue_singleton.py -->	Filtered data queue.
